Object-oriented approach

Neural_Network Class (float[]: input)
    Layer Class
        Node Class

-THE LOSS FUNCTION OF CHOICE USED FOR CLASSIFICATION VIA SOFTMAX ACTIVATION FUNCTION IS: CATEGORICAL CROSS-ENTROPY

-All hidden layers and output layer have activation function (output layer's might be different from the hidden layers)

-Initialize all weights within a range from -0.1 to 0.1. Don't initialize at 0.

-sigmoid activation function: y = 1 / (1 + e^(-x))
-RELU:
y = x | x > 0
  = 0 | x <= 0

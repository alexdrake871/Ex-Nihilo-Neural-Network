To-Do List

Neural Network Structure
-Output nodes should not have biases

Visualization
-Display a visualization of the current neural network
-Show weights as thicker and thinner lines
-Take a given input and show neuron activation with a bar or color gradient

Refactoring
-Make a base node class and make output and hidden nodes abstract classes
-Invalid number of layers/nodes handling

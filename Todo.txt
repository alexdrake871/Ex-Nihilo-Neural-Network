To-Do List

Neural Network Structure
-Activation function and batch type/size options as parameters in NN init function
-Perhaps can do batching in XNNN class - just store each layer output in some array

Data Handling
-Allow for full batch, mini-batch, and online training methods

Visualization
-Display a visualization of the current neural network
-Show weights as thicker and thinner lines
-Take a given input and show neuron activation with a bar or color gradient

Refactoring
-Make a base node class and make output and hidden nodes abstract classes
-Invalid number of layers/nodes handling
